# Mini Splitwise

There are people(**PERSON**). Some of them come together to form a group(**GROUP**). In that group, a particular person purchases good or services with his/her own personal money for (some) the members of the group. So the members of the group who consumed the service/product own the purchasing member some money.
With this the aim is to build a service that at the end of it all settle up everything, and gives us a list of who owns whom, how much.
