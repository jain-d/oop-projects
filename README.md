# Micro Library Management System | FAILED PROJECT


This is a failed project. Memory buffer overflowed midway working on it.
Got into the chicken-egg problem of should there be a persistence first from which code reads or should there be code first that creates the persistence.

Started with code but, after a few failed whiteboarding attempts to add persistence, got frustrated and gave to start [afresh](https://github.com/jain-d/oop-projects/tree/library-system-v2). OOP afterall is not that easy.
