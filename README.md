# Internalizing OOP

This is just a minor iteration and testing from the v2 build. This exist only because v2 was too pristine for testing this petty refactor.

After completing [v2](https://github.com/jain-d/oop-projects/tree/library-system-v2), I learnt what are some places where I can improve upon, to make my micro project resemble more feature from production grade OOP software.
I learnt how dict â†” DTO work for absolute isolation from caller object(which there won't be any because this time, it is dictionary that we are sending as arguement, not object).
